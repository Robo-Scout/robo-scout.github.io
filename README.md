RoboScout is a website that allows you to view scores, teams, events and more at VRC, VEXU, VAIC, and VIQC competitions. RoboScout gets its data from the [Red Alliance API](https://theredalliance.xyz) and displays it in a friendly way allowing anyone to easily access Robot Events data.

*Disclaimer: RoboScout is not affiliated with VEX or the REC Foundation in any way.*
